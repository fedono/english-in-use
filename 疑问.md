- 什么时候使用 has / have had 这种语法

  - 应该是这两个的意义是不一样的

  - 确实不一样，第二个是「拥有」的意思

  - 也就是我在过去拥有了某项东西，现在依然拥有，所以这里的 had 是过去式，第一个 has / have 是助动词，

    > "Had" by itself is the past tense, while "Has had" is the present perfect, meaning it began in the past and continues in the present.
    >
    > >  had 是过去式， has / have had 是现在完成式

    这样的句子如

    - He has had a car since I was seven.
    - She has known him since she was in high school.

    如果现在不确定有没有了，只是陈述过去有，就可以直接说成

    - He had a  car since I was seven

  - 解释参考

    > "Has + had" and "Have + had"
    >
    > "Has" and "have" are auxiliary (or helping) verbs used with a main verb (in your example, it's "have" in its past participle form "had") to express an action that started in the past and is continuing to the present. (The Present Perfect Tense)
    >
    > The main verb "have", meaning "to hold in possession", is converted to its past participle form which is "had." This is because the verb pattern used for the present perfect tense should be as follows:
    >
    > when your subject is singular (or for pronouns she, he, it): has + past participle form of the main verb
    > when you subject is plural (or for pronouns I, you, we, they): have + past participle form of the main verb
    >
    > Therefore, "I have had a car since I was seven" means act of possessing a car began when you were seven- an action in the past, that is still continuing to the present - you still own a car up to now.
    >
    > Other example sentences:
    > - She has known him since she was in high school.
    > - These cats have lived in my garage since I took them in.
